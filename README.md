# Black-Box: A Basic Deep Learning Framework

## Overview

**Black-Box** is a basic deep learning framework implemented from scratch. This project aims to provide an educational tool for understanding the fundamentals of deep learning by building core components manually.

## Features

- **Neural Network Modules**: Implementations of basic neural network layers and operations.
- **Training Utilities**: Functions for training models, including forward and backward propagation.
- **Example Models**: Sample implementations of common neural network architectures.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aamir-M-Khan/Black-Box.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Black-Box
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

## Usage

To run an example model, use the following command:
```bash
python run_example.py
